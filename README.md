# Wasted-Time
A silly project to keep us from writing on our thesis. ;)

The project came to fruition on a especially slow day while we were trying to write our thesis. 
It started as a simple collaboration on Syncfiddle, which led to creating a counter for how much time we spent procrastinating.

The idea expanded to add some gifs to make it more interesting. In the current state the gif bounces around the window and can be dragged and dropped around in the window. 

We will surely procrastinate even more so keep an eye out for even more features in the future.
